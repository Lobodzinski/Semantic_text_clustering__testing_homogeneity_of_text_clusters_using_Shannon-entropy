## Semantic text clustering: testing homogeneity of text clusters using Shannon entropy
### Topic:
validity of clusters of texts

### Description:
The provided code (_Semantic_Search__dynamical_estimation_of_the_cut_of_for_selected_matches.ipynb_) shows how we can determine the wrong clusters of texts using 
Shannon entropy and dynamically created entropy threshold in a set of clusters. 
The problem of such selection becomes very important when the texts being clustered 
contains a variety of topics and/or contain significantly different degrees of content. 
This method can determine the final solution or be a prelude to a more modified version of it.
