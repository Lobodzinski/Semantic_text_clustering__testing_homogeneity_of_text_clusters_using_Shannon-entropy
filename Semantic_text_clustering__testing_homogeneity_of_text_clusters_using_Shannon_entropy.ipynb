    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural language processing (NLP) projects are based on the task of semantic text clustering. In short, we have a set of statements (texts, phrases, or sentences), and our goal is to group them semantically. Nowadays, this is quite a classical problem with a rich literature on clustering methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that a given method has generated $N$ groups/clusters, each of which contains a set of similar texts. \n",
    "It is known that every cluster of similar texts is more or less homogeneous. There are clusters that are completely wrong in the sense of similarity of texts.   \n",
    "So to answer our original question\n",
    "#### How do we know that all clusters contain correct texts ?\n",
    "is to find those clusters that contain erroneous texts.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, I would like to propose the following method for determining the worst clusters:\n",
    "- checking intra-cluster similarity by computing the Shanon entropy of the set of texts belonging to a given cluster. \n",
    "- using dynamically determined threshold entropy to select the worst clusters (based on the method presented in my blog https://dataanalyticsforall.blogspot.com/2021/05/semantic-search-too-many-or-too-few.html\n",
    "\n",
    "As an experiment I will use reuters data, known as reuters-21578 \n",

       "      <td>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986 87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987 88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.</td>\n",

The company said the warrants are exercisable for five years at a purchase price of .125 dlrs per share. Computer Terminal said Sedio also has the right to buy additional shares and increase its total holdings up to 40 pct of the Computer Terminal s outstanding common stock under certain circumstances involving change of control at the company. The company said if the conditions occur the warrants would be exercisable at a price equal to 75 pct of its common stock s market price at the time, not to exceed 1.50 dlrs per share. Computer Terminal also said it sold the technolgy rights to its Dot Matrix impact technology, including any future improvements, to lt Woodco Inc&gt; of Houston, Tex. for 200,000 dlrs.

       "0  BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986 87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987 88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.   \n",

       "0  BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986 87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987 88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.   \n",

The company said the warrants are exercisable for five years at a purchase price of .125 dlrs per share. Computer Terminal said Sedio also has the right to buy additional shares and increase its total holdings up to 40 pct of the Computer Terminal s outstanding common stock under certain circumstances involving change of control at the company. The company said if the conditions occur the warrants would be exercisable at a price equal to 75 pct of its common stock s market price at the time, not to exceed 1.50 dlrs per share. Computer Terminal also said it sold the technolgy rights to its Dot Matrix impact technology, including any future improvements, to lt Woodco Inc> of Houston, Tex. for 200,000 dlrs. But, it said it would continue to be the exclusive worldwide licensee of the technology for Woodco. The company said the moves were part of its reorganization plan and would help pay current operation costs and ensure product delivery. Computer Terminal makes computer generated labels, forms, tags and ticket printers and terminals.   \n",

       "      <td>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986 87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987 88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.</td>\n",

       "0  BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986 87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987 88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.   \n",

They said a special committee of agricultural experts from EC member states had voiced strong objections over the measure during a meeting charged with preparing the ground for the annual EC farm price fixing which begins next Monday. They added that only France and Italy had indicated they would support the Commission proposal which would lead to a tax initially of 330 Ecus per tonne during the 1987 88 price round.\", \"MINISTER SEES ENOUGH EC STATES AGAINST OILS TAX Enough European Community EC states appear to be opposed to the proposals by the EC Commission for a 330 European currency unit Ecu a tonne tax on vegetable oils, fats and marine oils to block adoption by EC ministers, British Farm Minister Michael Jopling said. He told a news conference held during a meeting here of EC agriculture ministers that Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Portugal were all against the tax. Between them, these five countries had more than enough votes in the weighted voting system used in EC ministers meetings to block a decision, Jopling said.\", \"EC OILS TAX NO LONGER MAJOR ISSUE ASSOCIATION The proposed European Community EC tax on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association MFI said. Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference the West German feed industry believes the EC does not seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it would end in another transatlantic trade war. We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies. American Soybean Association ASA president elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected. Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on Thursday and Friday. There are indications the Bonn government will also reject the proposed tax, Wagner said.\", \"EC FARM LOBBIES BACK OILS AND FATS TAX PLAN The European Community EC farmers and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers. In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances. This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted. If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made available to journalists, said. Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC produced oils and marine fats. The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose from present levels.\", \"EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax. Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission s Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy. The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community s standstill agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy s oils and fats regime. The Commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal, he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal s objectives to maintain current import levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC s cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\"]</td>\n",

The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year, said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy, said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There s no real reason for it to change policy, said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges. All of the economists agreed that the Fed s major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further. Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year. The Fed said that banks net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period. In the single week to Wednesday, banks borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct. The Fed s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves. The Fed s absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg. Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two week borrowings average of 300 325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct. It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6 1 4 pct band. Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today. More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs. To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon pass may be required later. There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\", \"FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed, said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed s policy has been unchanged up to today. Although Volcker s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today s data, which covered the two week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed s decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today s data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday, said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous. The Fed couldn t have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its reserve projections, added Security Pacific s Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher than expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed s discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings, said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6 1 8 pct, said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. I expect it to continue in that vein. Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs, added First Chicago s Johnson. Banks excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M 1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper than anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar s progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar s effect on Fed policy, said First Chicago s Johnson. Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won t pull back from easing. \", \"FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is on hold and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said. The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy, said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change, said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M 1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M 2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M 3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M 1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M 2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M 3. February levels of M 2 and M 3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5 1 2 to 8 1 2 pct. There is no M 1 target. In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth, said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February s anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February s decline in the key M 2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February s weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M 2 and M 3 growth rates of 3 1 2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M 2 and M 3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy s fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy. Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct, said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.\"]</td>\n",

The full council was meeting at 1530 GMT to discuss the compromise, which was put together yesterday by ICCO chairman Denis Bra Kanon. Consumer delegates said they were optimistic the council could reach agreement on the rules fairly quickly.\", \"ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES The International Cocoa Organization ICCO Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said. The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the may buy level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions. The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself, was continuing, the delegates said. The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations.\", \"COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY The cocoa buffer stock rules just decided by the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council will take effect immediately, delegates said. That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin buying cocoa within two or three weeks, after organizing communication systems and assessing the market, they said.\", \"COCOA COUNCIL MEETING ENDS AFTER AGREEING RULES The International Cocoa Organization ICCO council adjourned after agreeing buffer stock rules for the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement, an ICCO spokesman said. The buffer stock will begin operations immediately, he said. He confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system, and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins. Purchases from non members will be limited to 15 pct of the total and buying or selling operations in any one day will be restricted to a maximum of 40 pct each for nearby, intermediate and forward positions, he said.\", \"COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ICCO is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices, a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the must buy level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world s largest cocoa producer. We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market, Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high quality cocoa is the world s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country s export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, Consumers weren t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers. Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9 12, ICCO officials said.\", \"COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive. European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said. At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month s meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. We are waiting to see what consumers say, a producer delegate said. We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate. The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer.\", \"ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.\", \"COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week, Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations optimistic and realistic. The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave an open minded statement that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place. Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon, delegates said.\", \"COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY The International Cocoa Organization ICCO moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday. Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday, a consumer delegate said. The atmosphere is excellent. Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon a big step toward a very interesting stage of negotiations, delegates said. The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers, the European Community EC and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said. The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is transparency, meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs both untouchable until rules are agreed. Though the current semi annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.\", \"ICCO BUFFER TO BUY 3,000 TONNES COCOA JUNE 3 The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization ICCO will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement. It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement. These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO s buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival delivery. The basis position will be afloat, May July shipment or June arrival delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account. The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time 1230 gmt in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins. The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store currently 23.00 pounds sterling from cif landed and 38.00 pounds sterling from cif shipping weights to in store and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said. No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added.\"]</td>\n",

General Acquisition said it is aware the board may be reviewing alternative transactions which might provide GenCorp shareholders with a payment other than cash. If that is the case, you should recognize that our additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide in any similarly structured transaction, the partnership said. General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp s board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for competing offers. The partnership requested that if any other proposal is under consideration that it be given the same information available to GenCorp s managers and advisers in constructing a proposal. General Acquisition said that if GenCorp agrees to accept another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision is made. General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp remove its poison pill or shareholders rights plan. General Acquisition said if GenCorp does not allow an environment for fair competition, it will take all steps necessary to create such an enviroment. It said it may take legal action or seek the support of shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board and to consider other proposals it might develop. General Acquisition also said if the board decides to accept an alternate proposal it asked that it not accept a plan that would include defensive features.\", \"TALKING POINT GENCORP INC lt GY&gt; The surprise 2.2 billion dlr tender offer for Ohio based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company, analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr per share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp s stock rose 15 3 4 to 106 1 4 in heavy trading. The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management s cooperation, said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton group. Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp s broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years, were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions. I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation, said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved, the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out. If it received the short form approval, General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp s plan to sell the stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station s license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR TV in Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company s plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting, including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share, he said. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company s Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp, founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. The management s doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non strategic assets of the company, Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there was some concern about greenmail. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders stock. I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing surprises me anymore, said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.\"]</td>\n",

ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it s difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage, Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week s March 31 April 2 meeting, the 16 member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September the next scheduled council meeting , Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using objective criteria, which would have threatened Brazil s share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO dissident producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.\", \"ICO BOARD PASSES OVER COFFEE QUOTA ISSUE Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. The situation is unchanged, consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas there is no point in meeting. At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using objective criteria, which would likely have reduced Brazil s share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags, he told Reuters. Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said. The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said. There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said. The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today s session, delegates said.\", \"ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY DELEGATES The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986 87 coffee year Oct 1 Sept 30 now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil s position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO s global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO s executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month s negotiations, they said. With Brazil s frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas, one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil s frost season mainly June August as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil s crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the other oilds producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of objective criteria favoured by consumers. At last month s council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on objective criteria. ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil s reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said.\", \"ICO PACT UNLIKELY BY AUTUMN ITALIAN ADVISER The prospects of the International Coffee Organization ICO reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation, said. There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas, Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the delegations. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas. The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1 but the full council is not due to meet again until September. I am not optimistic about an agreement soon, Hesse said.\", \"COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE BUT NO AGREEMENT YET Coffee quota talks at the International Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas, delegates said. The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they said. Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time. Anything could happen, one delegate said.\", \"ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ICO on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil s unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said. No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said. A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said.\", \"ICO COUNCIL ENDS IN FAILURE TO AGREE QUOTAS A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ICO council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said. Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said. Export quotas the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds. Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.\", \"DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS Consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said. Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional, Dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult. The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation ICO met in February. Dauster said Brazil s role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries. We have sacrificed a great deal already, he said. this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours. \"]</td>\n",

The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan s alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan s market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a clear indication that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month s meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business, said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions is more difficult. The U.S. Does not have the low end consumer IC s integrated circuits that the Japanese need for consumer products. They re well supplied here, said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high end IC s, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high end production skills, the analysts said. The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas, said Edwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd lt HIT.T&gt;, said the firm s reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory 256K DRAM was unrelated to MITI s efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one mln bit DRAM s, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans NEC Corp lt NESI.T&gt;, Japan s largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter. In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before. Hitachi Ltd s lt HIT.T&gt; April output of 256K DRAM s will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low. Toshiba Corp lt TSBA.T&gt; will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc MOT.N to sell the U.S. Firm s chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan. Mitsubishi Electric Corp MIET.T will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand. Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels. Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd OKIE.T will reduce April production by 10 pct from March s 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year s total of more than five billion yen, a company official said.\", \"JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said. Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry, analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs. We ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for D RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS, said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers. Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching, Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year s semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan s attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they re demonstating their muscle, analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers. I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production. He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write offs in plant and equipment.\", \"JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said. The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus. MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export. Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter. If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year. MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback. One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up. MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan U.S. Chip pact.\"]</td>\n",

Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price supporting agreements, broke down in February. Short term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents, said William O Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels. At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments, O Neill added. Rather than us having a market that will plummet we ll kind of see prices erode probably to around 85 cents. I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents, said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened, said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm s forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows. Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil s frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson s Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O Neill said, The roasters are not overstocked by any means. Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.\", \"COFFEE FUTURES AT SIX YEAR LOW, UNDER 1 DLR LB Coffee futures dipped further today and closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years. Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization s discussions aimed at re establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices, she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The increase in U.S. banks prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation, but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying.

Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower. Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition. Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department s report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices. Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses. Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower. Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday s USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year. Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year s 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected.\", \"COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4 1 2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried, Dauster said, adding now it is time to go and sell coffee. But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London s futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage, one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil s Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now, one consumer said.\", \"COFFEE COULD DROP TO 70 80 CTS, CARDENAS SAYS International coffee prices could drop to between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next October if no agreement is reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia s National Coffee Growers Federation said. Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the reasons was that the market was already saturated and that producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln 60 kg bags in 1987. Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a lb.\"]</td>\n",

USAir spokesman David Shipley also declined comment on Piedmont Aviation Inc lt PIE&gt;. USAir has offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont s stock, and 73 dlrs in its own stock for the balance. Piedmont also received an offer from Norfolk Southern Corp lt NSC&gt; of 65 dlrs cash per share. Piedmont s board was meeting today, but the company declined to say what was on the agenda. A spokesman said he could not comment on the twa action. A Norfolk Southern Corp lt NSC&gt; spokesman said the company had no comment on TWA s offer for USAir or on its proposal to negotiate a three way merger between TWA, USAir and Piedmont. We don t have all the details, a Norfolk Southern spokesman said. The company s 65 dlr a share cash offer for Piedmont stands, he said. In its offer, TWA said as an alternative to a merger with USAir, it would be interested in discussing a three way combination among USAir, Piedmont and TWA. It said the three way merger would serve the best interests of the shareholders of all three companies, employees and consumers.\", \"TWA lt TWA&gt; TANGLES PIEDMONT lt PIE&gt; SITUATION Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont s board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. We re just wondering if he s not just trying to get TWA into play. There s speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else, said one arbitrager. We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon. Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it s a credible offer, said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. I think it s certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals, said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline s stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5 3 8 at 49 1 8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1 2 to close at 69 5 8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines, said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. I don t know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package, said Kim. But Icahn s financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA s heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp lt X&gt; and still retains 11 pct of that company s stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier s USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street s insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. It s littered with contingencies and it doesn t even have a financing arrangement, said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA USAir would be a strong contender with USAir s east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA s pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\", \"USAIR lt U&gt; REJECTS TWA lt TWA&gt; TAKEOVER BID USAir Group Inc said its board has rejected Trans World Airlines Inc s offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers. The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn led TWA was highly conditional. USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc lt PIE&gt; met separately yesterday to consider USAir s offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group s proposed acquisition of Piedmont. TWA s proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group s acquisition of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests. USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA s last minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group s acquisition of Piedmont. The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the fair price provision contained in USAir s charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval. Reuter...\", \"TWA lt TWA&gt; CONFIRMS OWNERSHIP OF USAIR lt U&gt; STOCK Trans World Airlines Inc said it owns more than four mln USAir Group shares or about 15 pct of the total outstanding. TWA said it may acquire additional shares in the open market, in private transactions, through a tender offer or otherwise, subject to Department of Transportation approval. TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir rejected the offer yesterday, calling it a last minute attempt to interfere with its takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc. A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of Transportation, and later today it will file a response to USAir s motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application. TWA said it made the statement today on its stock position in USAir in response to inquiries. Traders said they believed TWA Chairman Carl Icahn was the buyer of an 855,000 share block crossed today by Salomon Brothers. USAir stock was trading at 50 3 4, up 2 1 4 on heavy volume of 3.1 mln shares. TWA stock fell 3 8 to 30 5 8. While analysts and arbitragers have speculated that Icahn may have made the offer for USAir in order to trigger the acquisition of his own airline, Wall Street today began to take Icahn s effort more seriously. I think he s going to be the next Frank Lorenzo of Wall Street, said one market source. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, has added to his airline with the acquisitions of Eastern Airlines and People Express Airlines. There was also speculation that Icahn would like to buy USAir and then sell TWA as a merged company.\", \"USAIR lt U&gt; SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA lt TWA&gt; USAir Group said it sought the help of the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight with Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order TWA to sell its USAir shares. What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal Aviation Act, USAir said. It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the Department of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65 billion dlr takeover of USAir. USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department of Transportation to dismiss the application. USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided pre merger notification requirements, and also did not provide a competitive and public interest analysis required under regulations. USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding shares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10 pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir s stock. TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to more than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding. TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said the company had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was in compliance with the law.\", \"TWA lt TWA&gt; DECLINES COMMENT ON USAIR lt U&gt; A Transworld Airlines Inc official said the airline has no comment on USAir Group Inc s planned buyout of Piedmont Aviation Inc. TWA, however, has pursued its application with the Department of Transportation for a takeover of USAir, according to Mark Buckstein, TWA general counsel and vice president. TWA filed a revised application today, following the DOT s rejection Friday of an incomplete application filed last week. Earlier USAir said it agreed to buy Piedmont for 69 dlrs cash per share.\", \"TRANS WORLD AIRLINES lt TWA&gt; FILES ON USAIR lt U&gt; Trans World Airlines said it told the Securities and Exchange Commission it does not intend to seek control of USAir Group or to acquire more of its stock at this time. TWA also said it is amending its application with the Department of Transportation to seek control of USAir. The amendment said TWA reserves the right to seek control of USAir in the future, that it intends to maintain its 15 pct stake, and that it also is seeking the flexibility to acquire up to 25 pct of USAir. TWA said all USAir stock owned by it would be in a voting trust and voted in the same proportion as the vote of all other USAir shareholders. TWA filed a 13 D with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reporting its holding of 4,023,200 shares of USAir. TWA has said the stake amounts to about 15 pct. TWA also said that by order of the federal court in Pittsburgh, it is temporarily barred from buying additional shares of USAir pending a hearing March 23 to reconsider USAir s application to expand the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction.\", \"TWA lt TWA&gt; IN COURT SETTLEMENT WITH USAIR lt U&gt; Trans World Airlines Inc said it reached an agreement yesterday in federal court with USAir Group Inc that prevents TWA from buying additional shares of USAir. Under the agreement, TWA, which holds about 15 pct of USAir stock, will not buy more USAir shares before April 23 and will not do so after that date without giving 14 days notice to USAir. TWA also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly interfere with the consummation of the merger between USAir and Piedmont Aviation Inc lt PIE&gt;. TWA said the court agreement confirms previous announcements by the company, in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that it does not presently intend to seek control of USAir or to acquire additional common stock. As a result of the agreement, the court removed a previous temporary restraining order against TWA, the company said. TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between them in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23. TWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to regulatory agencies on the USAir, Piedmont merger. In a separate statement, USAir said the agreement also included a provision that all USAir shares currently owned by TWA and its chairman, Carl Icahn, will be voted through a voting trust in proportion to the votes of other shares not controlled by TWA or Icahn.\"]</td>\n",

Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance. He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC s December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: Apparently they have taken care of that. They the GCC meet very often among themselves. I think they ll help each other, he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC s Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date. Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices, he said.\", \"EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output excluding movements into stocks fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar s February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria s early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria s customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea. Country by country production figures are as follows, in mln bpd COUNTRY CURRENT FEBRUARY QUOTA ALGERIA 0.64 0.64 0.635 ECUADOR 0.26 0.26 0.210 GABON 0.15 0.15 0.152 INDONESIA 1.16 1.16 1.133 IRAN 1.80 2.20 2.255 IRAQ 1.75 1.75 1.466 KUWAIT 1.15 1.40 0.948 LIBYA 0.95 0.95 0.948 NIGERIA 1.00 1.14 1.238 QATAR 0.18 0.23 0.285 SAUDI ARABIA 3.10 3.50 4.133 UAE 1.10 1.15 0.902 VENEZUELA 1.50 1.50 1.495 TOTAL 14.7 16.0 15.8 Reuter\", \"OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING OPEC output in February was well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying. The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result of member countries firm determination to defend the organisation s official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price. The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month. No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail, the statement said. The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price, the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC s official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled because of member countries firm determination to defend the price system agreed in December. Opec s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven state body. Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Nigeria and Qatar.\", \"OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. We are determined to stand firm by the December accord, he said. I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work, he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said That could well be correct. Opec s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in February, Nigeria propuced 75 100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States West Texas Intermediate WTI crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals, he said, adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline rich crudes such as Nigeria s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels, they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. When they realise it is not a free for all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on, he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. At this time, we have to get our priorities right, he said. The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades. But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.\", \"OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target. He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs. We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production is less than 15.8 mln at the moment, he stated. Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June. We will discuss the market situation then, he added. He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because there is no need for the meeting. He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week.\", \"OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec s output level was now, he replied: Below 15.8 mln barrels per day . He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters. Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.\"]</td>\n",

It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana CEPE notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor. Ecuador s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day bpd . A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador s main pipeline was damaged. He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed. The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12 point international Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano, he said. The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia, according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.\", \"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12 point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC , was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day bpd of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month s imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country s total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.\", \"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.

Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc lt TX.N&gt; and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two thirds of Ecuador s total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180 day period. He added the Caracas based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries, the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.\", \"ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said. Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific. About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day bpd , has been built, he said. Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake. The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia s pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco. The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said.\", \"ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp CEPE said. CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country s main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia s pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.\"]</td>\n",

The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD , is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned. It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed. He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement ITA , were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled. Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement. \", \"RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet, he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the may buy or may sell and must buy or must sell levels without changing the lower indicative price or floor price of 150 Malaysian Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian Singapore cents a kilo, and of the lower indicative price if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.\", \"NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the make or break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good. The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price set at 201.66 Malaysian Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the lower indicative price, under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the may buy or may sell and must buy or must sell levels, without changing the lower indicative price which is set at 150 Malaysian Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.\", \"MAJOR DIFFERENCES RESOLVED AT RUBBER PACT TALKS Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference chairman Manaspas Xuto said. We have resolved major differences of opinion, he told Reuters. Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord, to replace the current one which expires in October. Xuto said: I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption since the talks began last Monday. It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement, he added. The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD , is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1 Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12 month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2 If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below or above the lower intervention price or the upper intervention price , the reference price will be automatically revised downwards or upwards by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3 If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian Singapore cents above the floor price or 152 cents. 4 The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last night, setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock. The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Britain are the major consumers. UNCTAD s latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.\", \"NEGOTIATORS DRAFT DETAILS OF NEXT RUBBER PACT Rubber producers and consumers, who agreed last week on the central elements of a new international natural rubber pact, have started work on the legal drafting of a future accord, delegates said. Compromise on issues blocking an agreement was reached at a United Nations conference on an accord to replace the current pact, which expires in October. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA is expected to be formally adopted on Friday.\", \"NEGOTIATORS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO NEW RUBBER PACT Rubber producing and consuming countries, which agreed on the bases of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA last weekend, are now putting the final touches to the future accord, delegates said. They said discussions are focusing on conditions for entry into force of the new INRA. The present pact, which expires in October, required that governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports approved or ratified the pact before it became operational. Delegates said figures now being floated range between 65 and 80 pct.\", \"NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said. The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation, he told a news conference. The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD , reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price of 201.66 Malaysian Singapore cents per kilo and indicative prices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian Singapore currency, he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges the may sell and may buy points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the must sell and must buy zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord. The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply, he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto added. At this month s session, which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months instead of the current 18 month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention may sell price currently 231 Malaysian Singapore cents or below the lower intervention price may buy price 171 cents at present for six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact, the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the lower indicative price or floor price of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\", \"NEW RUBBER PACT ADOPTED AT GENEVA CONFERENCE Producers and consumers representing most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA aimed at stabilizing world prices over the next five years. Negotiations for a new INRA, to succeed the present one which runs out next October, began nearly two years ago. Agreement on the new five year pact, which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall, was reached at a two week session here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD .\"]</td>\n",

Earlier Supermarkets General said an unsolicited third party had made the offer. Analysts estimated the value at about 1.6 billion dlrs, based on 38.5 mln shares outstanding. Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc told Dart that Kidder s affiliate will be prepared to advance up to 750 mln dlrs on a subordinated basis.\", \"WALL STREET STOCKS SUPERMARKETS GENERAL lt SGL&gt; Dart Group Corp lt DARTA&gt;, which wants to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks another buyer, arbitrageurs said. Speculation that Dart s offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets shares gain one to 42 1 8 on 2.3 mln shares. One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc lt FDS&gt; taking a look at Supermarkets General. Our policy is that we do not comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature, a Federated spokeswoman said. An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairman Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised its initial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when Safeway resisted. However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that topped the Hafts. If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the arbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts present bid seemed quite fair. He said the offer amounts to 10 times after tax cash flow which is probably fully priced. \", \"DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS lt SGL&gt; BID lt Dart Group Corp&gt; said it told Supermarkets General Corp lt SGL&gt; it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company. Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL s books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms, said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL s approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management s incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company s compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management s supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company s present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.\", \"DART GROUP RAISES SUPERMARKETS GENERAL lt SGL&gt; BID lt Dart Group Corp&gt; said it has raised its offer to acquire Supermarkets General Corp to 42.00 dlrs in cash and three dlrs in exchangeable preferred stock per Supermarkets General share from 41.75 dlrs per share in cash. The company said it would also be willing to negotiate a plan with the Supermarkets General board under which Supermarkets General shareholders would have a common stock interest in the combined company. It said it remains willing to negotiate all terms of the proposed acquisition. The original bid was worth about 1.62 billion dlrs. Dart said the preferred stock in the new bid would be exchangeable for a new class of Supermarkets General debt securities that would be developed by Dart and Supermarkets. The new proposal would be subject to approval by the Supermarkets General board, it said. The new bid was contained in a letter to the Supermarkets General board. In Woodbridge, N.J., Supermarkets General responding to a previous letter to its board by Dart said Your conduct indicates to us that no transaction involving trust and confidence can be entered into with you. Your propaganda and missstatements will not panic our board.

There is no need for action, Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels and Frankfurter Bank BHF said. Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out. One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed. Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact. But such demands could re emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit. Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates. Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January. Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation. Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year. The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing, one economist said. He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds. This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium term. These developments were increasing the Bundesbank s scope for a rate cut in the medium term, economists said. Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected. Call money rates declined to 3.75 80 pct from 3.90 95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity. Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month s major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market. The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government owned banks. Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80. One dealer said, If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down. Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.\", \"NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week s pact to keep short term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week s tender. I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks, one dealer said. They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer, he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85 95 pct, up from 3.80 90 yesterday.\", \"BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said. The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1 2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50 70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard, Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder, he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash. Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further, said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst s Hutmann. Bethmann s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. But I don t expect any convincing measures, he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60 70 pct from 3.75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.\"]</td>\n",

Wendy s is currently trading up one at 11 3 4 on turnover of more than 1.6 mln shares. A Wendy s spokesman said it was corporate policy not to comment on market rumors. He further declined to attribute active trading in Wendy s stock to a published report which stated Wall Street professionals believe that Wendy s was possibly being studied by Coca Cola Co KO with view to a possible acquisition.\", \"COCA COLA lt KO&gt; SAYS RUMORS INCORRECT A Coca Cola Co spokesman said rumors the company is interested in acquiring Wendy s International lt WEN&gt; are not true. Those rumors are not correct, said Carlton Curtis, an assistant vice president at Coke. We have stated many times that Coca Cola Co has no interest in an acquisition in the food service industry and thereby becoming a competitor to our food service customers. Wendy s stock has been flying high on the rumors for two days. Today, Wendy s hit a high of 13 3 8 before dropping back to 12 3 8, up 5 8 in heavy trading.\", \"TALKING POINT WENDY S INTERNATIONAL lt WEN&gt; Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy s International Inc s stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor. Wendy s retreated from an earlier high of 13 3 8, and lost a point when Coca Cola lt KO&gt; said the rumors were untrue. However, Wendy s remained up 5 8 at 12 3 8 on volume of more than three mln shares. Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible. Wendy s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet, a Wendy s spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill. Market sources mentioned Anheuser Busch Inc lt BUD&gt; and Pepsico Inc lt PEP&gt; as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy s official. It doesn t happen every day, every week, every month, but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies, said Denny Lynch, Wendy s vice president of communications. However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors. Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them. I can t put another name on it, said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy s stock. It very well could be someone s interested. But Freedman said he doesn t believe now is the right time for Wendy s to be sold. They re obviously having operational difficulties. I ve always believed at the right price Wendy s would consider an offer , but I can t believe this is the right price at the right time, Freedman said. If a transaction takes place, the buyer s going to control the situation, Freedman said. I just don t think there s anything going on. I don t think it s worth much more than where it is, said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney. Analysts said Wendy s has suffered largely from the burger wars between itself, McDonald s Corp lt MCD&gt; and Pillsbury Co s lt PSY&gt; Burger King chain. Wendy s, the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year, analysts said. Wendy s also fumbled when it introduced a high priced breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products, but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround. There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy s may be vulnerable to a takeover. James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy s could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break up basis. He said the company has improved its debt to equity ratio and Wendy s owns a high percent of its own restaurants 38 pct of 3,500. They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants, Murren said. Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year, Wendy s real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the fourth quarter. That was about the first time in seven quarters, he said. Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy s. My gut feeling is something s going to happen. I don t know what, she said. She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share. One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy s decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi. Wendy s is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said. Pepsi s soda is still sold in the Wendy s restaurants.\"]</td>\n",

reservations over a tax on both imported and domestically produced oils and fats proposed by the European Commission, senior diplomats said. They said a special committee of agricultural experts from EC member states had voiced strong objections over the measure during a meeting charged with preparing the ground for the annual EC farm price fixing which begins next Monday. They added that only France and Italy had indicated they would support the Commission proposal which would lead to a tax initially of 330 Ecus per tonne during the 1987 88 price round.\", \"MINISTER SEES ENOUGH EC STATES AGAINST OILS TAX Enough European Community EC states appear to be opposed to the proposals by the EC Commission for a 330 European currency unit Ecu a tonne tax on vegetable oils, fats and marine oils to block adoption by EC ministers, British Farm Minister Michael Jopling said. He told a news conference held during a meeting here of EC agriculture ministers that Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Portugal were all against the tax. Between them, these five countries had more than enough votes in the weighted voting system used in EC ministers meetings to block a decision, Jopling said.\", \"EC OILS TAX NO LONGER MAJOR ISSUE ASSOCIATION The proposed European Community EC tax on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association MFI said. Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference the West German feed industry believes the EC does not seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it would end in another transatlantic trade war. We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies. American Soybean Association ASA president elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers were confident the tax would be rejected. Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on Thursday and Friday. There are indications the Bonn government will also reject the proposed tax, Wagner said.\", \"EC FARM LOBBIES BACK OILS AND FATS TAX PLAN The European Community EC farmers and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers. In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances. This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted. If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made available to journalists, said. Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC produced oils and marine fats. The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose from present levels.\", \"EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax. Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission s Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy. The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community s standstill agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy s oils and fats regime. The Commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal, he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal s objectives to maintain current import levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC s cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\"]   \n",

HOLD Federal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week s Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting, economists said. The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year, said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy, said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There s no real reason for it to change policy, said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges. All of the economists agreed that the Fed s major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further. Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year. The Fed said that banks net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period. In the single week to Wednesday, banks borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct. The Fed s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves. The Fed s absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg. Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two week borrowings average of 300 325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct. It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6 1 4 pct band. Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today. More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs. To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon pass may be required later. There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\", \"FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed, said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed s policy has been unchanged up to today. Although Volcker s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today s data, which covered the two week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed s decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today s data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday, said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous. The Fed couldn t have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its reserve projections, added Security Pacific s Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher than expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed s discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings, said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6 1 8 pct, said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. I expect it to continue in that vein. Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs, added First Chicago s Johnson. Banks excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M 1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper than anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar s progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar s effect on Fed policy, said First Chicago s Johnson. Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won t pull back from easing. \", \"FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is on hold and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said. The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy, said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change, said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M 1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M 2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M 3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M 1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M 2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M 3. February levels of M 2 and M 3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5 1 2 to 8 1 2 pct. There is no M 1 target. In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth, said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February s anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February s decline in the key M 2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February s weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M 2 and M 3 growth rates of 3 1 2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M 2 and M 3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy s fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy. Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct, said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.\"]   \n",

The full council was meeting at 1530 GMT to discuss the compromise, which was put together yesterday by ICCO chairman Denis Bra Kanon. Consumer delegates said they were optimistic the council could reach agreement on the rules fairly quickly.\", \"ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES The International Cocoa Organization ICCO Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said. The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the may buy level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions. The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself, was continuing, the delegates said. The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations.\", \"COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY The cocoa buffer stock rules just decided by the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council will take effect immediately, delegates said. That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin buying cocoa within two or three weeks, after organizing communication systems and assessing the market, they said.\", \"COCOA COUNCIL MEETING ENDS AFTER AGREEING RULES The International Cocoa Organization ICCO council adjourned after agreeing buffer stock rules for the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement, an ICCO spokesman said. The buffer stock will begin operations immediately, he said. He confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system, and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins. Purchases from non members will be limited to 15 pct of the total and buying or selling operations in any one day will be restricted to a maximum of 40 pct each for nearby, intermediate and forward positions, he said.\", \"COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ICCO is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices, a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the must buy level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world s largest cocoa producer. We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market, Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high quality cocoa is the world s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country s export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, Consumers weren t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers. Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9 12, ICCO officials said.\", \"COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive. European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said. At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month s meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. We are waiting to see what consumers say, a producer delegate said. We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate. The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer.\", \"ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.\", \"COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week, Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations optimistic and realistic. The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave an open minded statement that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place. Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon, delegates said.\", \"COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY The International Cocoa Organization ICCO moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday. Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday, a consumer delegate said. The atmosphere is excellent. Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon a big step toward a very interesting stage of negotiations, delegates said. The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers, the European Community EC and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said. The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is transparency, meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs both untouchable until rules are agreed. Though the current semi annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.\", \"ICCO BUFFER TO BUY 3,000 TONNES COCOA JUNE 3 The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization ICCO will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement. It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement. These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO s buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival delivery. The basis position will be afloat, May July shipment or June arrival delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account. The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time 1230 gmt in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins. The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store currently 23.00 pounds sterling from cif landed and 38.00 pounds sterling from cif shipping weights to in store and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said. No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added.\"]   \n",

General Acquisition Co, a partnership of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc lt AFG>, reiterated in a statement sent to GenCorp on Friday that it was willing to negotiate its earlier offer of 100 dlrs a share for the tire, broadcasting, plastics and aerospace conglomerate. Analysts have speculated GenCorp could fetch at least 110 to 120 dlrs per share if broken up. GenCorp officials declined to comment on the statement, but a spokesman reiterated a request to shareholders to wait until the board renders an opinion before making a decision on the offer. GenCorp has said a statement would be made on or before the company s annual meeting on Tuesday. General Acquisition said the board could not carry out its duties to shareholders and make an informed decision until it has, ... Explored with us the ways in which our offer can be revised to provide greater value to your shareholders. General Acquisition added it was aware the board may be reviewing alternative transactions, which might provide GenCorp shareholders with a payment other than cash.

Analysts estimated the 100 dlr per share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp s stock rose 15 3 4 to 106 1 4 in heavy trading. The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management s cooperation, said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton group. Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp s broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years, were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions. I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation, said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved, the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out. If it received the short form approval, General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp s plan to sell the stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station s license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR TV in Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company s plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting, including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share, he said. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company s Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp, founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. The management s doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non strategic assets of the company, Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there was some concern about greenmail. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders stock. I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing surprises me anymore, said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.\"]   \n",

International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it s difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage, Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week s March 31 April 2 meeting, the 16 member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September the next scheduled council meeting , Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using objective criteria, which would have threatened Brazil s share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO dissident producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.\", \"ICO BOARD PASSES OVER COFFEE QUOTA ISSUE Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. The situation is unchanged, consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas there is no point in meeting. At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using objective criteria, which would likely have reduced Brazil s share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags, he told Reuters. Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said. The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said. There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said. The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today s session, delegates said.\", \"ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY DELEGATES The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986 87 coffee year Oct 1 Sept 30 now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil s position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO s global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO s executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month s negotiations, they said. With Brazil s frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas, one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil s frost season mainly June August as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil s crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the other oilds producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of objective criteria favoured by consumers. At last month s council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on objective criteria. ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil s reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said.\", \"ICO PACT UNLIKELY BY AUTUMN ITALIAN ADVISER The prospects of the International Coffee Organization ICO reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation, said. There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas, Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the delegations. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas. The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1 but the full council is not due to meet again until September. I am not optimistic about an agreement soon, Hesse said.\", \"COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE BUT NO AGREEMENT YET Coffee quota talks at the International Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas, delegates said. The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they said. Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time. Anything could happen, one delegate said.\", \"ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ICO on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil s unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said. No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said. A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said.\", \"ICO COUNCIL ENDS IN FAILURE TO AGREE QUOTAS A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization ICO council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said. Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said. Export quotas the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds. Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.\", \"DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS Consumer countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas, Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said. Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional, Dauster, a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. When consumers want to get involved, talks are much more difficult. The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation ICO met in February. Dauster said Brazil s role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries. We have sacrificed a great deal already, he said. this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours. \"]   \n",

key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan s alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan s market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a clear indication that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter, following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month s meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business, said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output, boosting imports the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions is more difficult. The U.S. Does not have the low end consumer IC s integrated circuits that the Japanese need for consumer products. They re well supplied here, said Richard May, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high end IC s, but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high end production skills, the analysts said. The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas, said Edwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd lt HIT.T>, said the firm s reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory 256K DRAM was unrelated to MITI s efforts to ward off the trade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one mln bit DRAM s, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans NEC Corp lt NESI.T>, Japan s largest chipmaker, plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter. In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip imports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before. Hitachi Ltd s lt HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM s will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target. Imports are currently very low. Toshiba Corp lt TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc MOT.N to sell the U.S. Firm s chips in Japan. The firms are planning a joint venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern Japan. Mitsubishi Electric Corp MIET.T will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased imports but an official said boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand. Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels. Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd OKIE.T will reduce April production by 10 pct from March s 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year s total of more than five billion yen, a company official said.\", \"JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said. Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry, analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs. We ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for D RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS, said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers. Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching, Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year s semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan s attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they re demonstating their muscle, analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers. I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production. He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write offs in plant and equipment.\", \"JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said. The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus. MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export. Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter. If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year. MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback. One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up. MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan U.S. Chip pact.\"]   \n",

Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price supporting agreements, broke down in February. Short term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents, said William O Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels. At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments, O Neill added. Rather than us having a market that will plummet we ll kind of see prices erode probably to around 85 cents. I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents, said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened, said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm s forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows. Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil s frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson s Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O Neill said, The roasters are not overstocked by any means. Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.\", \"COFFEE FUTURES AT SIX YEAR LOW, UNDER 1 DLR LB Coffee futures dipped further today and closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years. Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization s discussions aimed at re establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices, she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said. Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The increase in U.S. banks prime rates prompted concern about renewed inflation, but the strength of the U.S. dollar discouraged new buying. The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn t know which way to go, one analyst said.

Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen pork bellies finished sharply lower. Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition. Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture Department s report Tuesday that producers expanded their breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter. Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices. Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater production and closed with limit losses. Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were lower. Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday s USDA report that farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from 61.5 mln planted last year. Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln acres of corn, which is down from last year s 76.7 mln acres, but was larger than analysts expected.\", \"COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4 1 2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried, Dauster said, adding now it is time to go and sell coffee. But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London s futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage, one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil s Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now, one consumer said.\", \"COFFEE COULD DROP TO 70 80 CTS, CARDENAS SAYS International coffee prices could drop to between 70 and 80 cents a lb by next October if no agreement is reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia s National Coffee Growers Federation said.

share. USAir spokesman David Shipley also declined comment on Piedmont Aviation Inc lt PIE>. USAir has offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont s stock, and 73 dlrs in its own stock for the balance. Piedmont also received an offer from Norfolk Southern Corp lt NSC> of 65 dlrs cash per share. Piedmont s board was meeting today, but the company declined to say what was on the agenda. A spokesman said he could not comment on the twa action. A Norfolk Southern Corp lt NSC> spokesman said the company had no comment on TWA s offer for USAir or on its proposal to negotiate a three way merger between TWA, USAir and Piedmont. We don t have all the details, a Norfolk Southern spokesman said. The company s 65 dlr a share cash offer for Piedmont stands, he said. In its offer, TWA said as an alternative to a merger with USAir, it would be interested in discussing a three way combination among USAir, Piedmont and TWA. It said the three way merger would serve the best interests of the shareholders of all three companies, employees and consumers.\", \"TWA lt TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT lt PIE> SITUATION Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont s board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. We re just wondering if he s not just trying to get TWA into play. There s speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else, said one arbitrager. We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon. Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it s a credible offer, said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. I think it s certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals, said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline s stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5 3 8 at 49 1 8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1 2 to close at 69 5 8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines, said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. I don t know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package, said Kim. But Icahn s financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA s heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp lt X> and still retains 11 pct of that company s stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier s USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street s insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. It s littered with contingencies and it doesn t even have a financing arrangement, said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA USAir would be a strong contender with USAir s east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA s pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\", \"USAIR lt U> REJECTS TWA lt TWA> TAKEOVER BID USAir Group Inc said its board has rejected Trans World Airlines Inc s offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers. The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn led TWA was highly conditional. USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc lt PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir s offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group s proposed acquisition of Piedmont. TWA s proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group s acquisition of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests. USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA s last minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group s acquisition of Piedmont. The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the fair price provision contained in USAir s charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval. Reuter...\", \"TWA lt TWA> CONFIRMS OWNERSHIP OF USAIR lt U> STOCK Trans World Airlines Inc said it owns more than four mln USAir Group shares or about 15 pct of the total outstanding. TWA said it may acquire additional shares in the open market, in private transactions, through a tender offer or otherwise, subject to Department of Transportation approval. TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir rejected the offer yesterday, calling it a last minute attempt to interfere with its takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc. A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of Transportation, and later today it will file a response to USAir s motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application. TWA said it made the statement today on its stock position in USAir in response to inquiries. Traders said they believed TWA Chairman Carl Icahn was the buyer of an 855,000 share block crossed today by Salomon Brothers. USAir stock was trading at 50 3 4, up 2 1 4 on heavy volume of 3.1 mln shares. TWA stock fell 3 8 to 30 5 8. While analysts and arbitragers have speculated that Icahn may have made the offer for USAir in order to trigger the acquisition of his own airline, Wall Street today began to take Icahn s effort more seriously. I think he s going to be the next Frank Lorenzo of Wall Street, said one market source. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, has added to his airline with the acquisitions of Eastern Airlines and People Express Airlines. There was also speculation that Icahn would like to buy USAir and then sell TWA as a merged company.\", \"USAIR lt U> SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA lt TWA> USAir Group said it sought the help of the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight with Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order TWA to sell its USAir shares. What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal Aviation Act, USAir said. It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the Department of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65 billion dlr takeover of USAir. USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department of Transportation to dismiss the application. USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided pre merger notification requirements, and also did not provide a competitive and public interest analysis required under regulations. USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be limited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding shares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10 pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir s stock. TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to more than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding. TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said the company had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was in compliance with the law.\", \"TWA lt TWA> DECLINES COMMENT ON USAIR lt U> A Transworld Airlines Inc official said the airline has no comment on USAir Group Inc s planned buyout of Piedmont Aviation Inc.

TWA also said it is amending its application with the Department of Transportation to seek control of USAir. The amendment said TWA reserves the right to seek control of USAir in the future, that it intends to maintain its 15 pct stake, and that it also is seeking the flexibility to acquire up to 25 pct of USAir. TWA said all USAir stock owned by it would be in a voting trust and voted in the same proportion as the vote of all other USAir shareholders. TWA filed a 13 D with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reporting its holding of 4,023,200 shares of USAir. TWA has said the stake amounts to about 15 pct. TWA also said that by order of the federal court in Pittsburgh, it is temporarily barred from buying additional shares of USAir pending a hearing March 23 to reconsider USAir s application to expand the temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction.\", \"TWA lt TWA> IN COURT SETTLEMENT WITH USAIR lt U> Trans World Airlines Inc said it reached an agreement yesterday in federal court with USAir Group Inc that prevents TWA from buying additional shares of USAir. Under the agreement, TWA, which holds about 15 pct of USAir stock, will not buy more USAir shares before April 23 and will not do so after that date without giving 14 days notice to USAir. TWA also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly interfere with the consummation of the merger between USAir and Piedmont Aviation Inc lt PIE>. TWA said the court agreement confirms previous announcements by the company, in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that it does not presently intend to seek control of USAir or to acquire additional common stock. As a result of the agreement, the court removed a previous temporary restraining order against TWA, the company said. TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between them in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23. TWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to regulatory agencies on the USAir, Piedmont merger. In a separate statement, USAir said the agreement also included a provision that all USAir shares currently owned by TWA and its chairman, Carl Icahn, will be voted through a voting trust in proportion to the votes of other shares not controlled by TWA or Icahn.\"]   \n",

the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance. He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC s December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: Apparently they have taken care of that. They the GCC meet very often among themselves. I think they ll help each other, he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC s Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date. Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices, he said.\", \"EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output excluding movements into stocks fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar s February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria s early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria s customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea. Country by country production figures are as follows, in mln bpd COUNTRY CURRENT FEBRUARY QUOTA ALGERIA 0.64 0.64 0.635 ECUADOR 0.26 0.26 0.210 GABON 0.15 0.15 0.152 INDONESIA 1.16 1.16 1.133 IRAN 1.80 2.20 2.255 IRAQ 1.75 1.75 1.466 KUWAIT 1.15 1.40 0.948 LIBYA 0.95 0.95 0.948 NIGERIA 1.00 1.14 1.238 QATAR 0.18 0.23 0.285 SAUDI ARABIA 3.10 3.50 4.133 UAE 1.10 1.15 0.902 VENEZUELA 1.50 1.50 1.495 TOTAL 14.7 16.0 15.8 Reuter\", \"OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING OPEC output in February was well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying. The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result of member countries firm determination to defend the organisation s official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price. The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month. No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail, the statement said. The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price, the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC s official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled because of member countries firm determination to defend the price system agreed in December. Opec s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven state body. Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Nigeria and Qatar.\", \"OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. We are determined to stand firm by the December accord, he said. I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work, he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said That could well be correct. Opec s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in February, Nigeria propuced 75 100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States West Texas Intermediate WTI crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals, he said, adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline rich crudes such as Nigeria s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels, they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. When they realise it is not a free for all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on, he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. At this time, we have to get our priorities right, he said. The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades. But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.\", \"OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target. He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs. We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production is less than 15.8 mln at the moment, he stated. Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June. We will discuss the market situation then, he added. He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because there is no need for the meeting. He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week.\", \"OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec s output level was now, he replied: Below 15.8 mln barrels per day . He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel s December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters. Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.\"]   \n",

suspended its crude oil exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy and Mines MInistry statement said. It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana CEPE notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor. Ecuador s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day bpd . A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador s main pipeline was damaged. He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed. The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12 point international Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano, he said. The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia, according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.\", \"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12 point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC , was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day bpd of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month s imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country s total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.\", \"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.

Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc lt TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two thirds of Ecuador s total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180 day period. He added the Caracas based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries, the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.\", \"ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said. Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific. About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day bpd , has been built, he said. Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake. The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia s pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco. The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said.\", \"ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp CEPE said. CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country s main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia s pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.\"]   \n",

The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD , is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned. It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed. He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement ITA , were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled. Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement. \", \"RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said. There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet, he said. The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price, and the may buy or may sell and must buy or must sell levels without changing the lower indicative price or floor price of 150 Malaysian Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five day average of the indicator price is around 192 Malaysian Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price, set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian Singapore cents a kilo, and of the lower indicative price if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.\", \"NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the make or break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, There is nothing concrete yet, but the atmosphere is good. The discussions are expected to continue late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price set at 201.66 Malaysian Singapore cents a kilo in the current agreement for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called the lower indicative price, under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price, and the may buy or may sell and must buy or must sell levels, without changing the lower indicative price which is set at 150 Malaysian Singapore cents in the current pact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.\", \"MAJOR DIFFERENCES RESOLVED AT RUBBER PACT TALKS Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference chairman Manaspas Xuto said. We have resolved major differences of opinion, he told Reuters. Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord, to replace the current one which expires in October. Xuto said: I welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has prevailed without interruption since the talks began last Monday. It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement, he added. The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD , is the fourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points: 1 Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12 month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2 If the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below or above the lower intervention price or the upper intervention price , the reference price will be automatically revised downwards or upwards by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber Organisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3 If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two Malaysian Singapore cents above the floor price or 152 cents. 4 The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last night, setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new five year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in October over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock. The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and Britain are the major consumers. UNCTAD s latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.\", \"NEGOTIATORS DRAFT DETAILS OF NEXT RUBBER PACT Rubber producers and consumers, who agreed last week on the central elements of a new international natural rubber pact, have started work on the legal drafting of a future accord, delegates said. Compromise on issues blocking an agreement was reached at a United Nations conference on an accord to replace the current pact, which expires in October. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA is expected to be formally adopted on Friday.\", \"NEGOTIATORS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO NEW RUBBER PACT Rubber producing and consuming countries, which agreed on the bases of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA last weekend, are now putting the final touches to the future accord, delegates said. They said discussions are focusing on conditions for entry into force of the new INRA. The present pact, which expires in October, required that governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports approved or ratified the pact before it became operational. Delegates said figures now being floated range between 65 and 80 pct.\", \"NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said. The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation, he told a news conference. The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD , reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price of 201.66 Malaysian Singapore cents per kilo and indicative prices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian Singapore currency, he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges the may sell and may buy points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the must sell and must buy zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord. The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply, he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto added. At this month s session, which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months instead of the current 18 month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention may sell price currently 231 Malaysian Singapore cents or below the lower intervention price may buy price 171 cents at present for six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact, the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the lower indicative price or floor price of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\", \"NEW RUBBER PACT ADOPTED AT GENEVA CONFERENCE Producers and consumers representing most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA aimed at stabilizing world prices over the next five years. Negotiations for a new INRA, to succeed the present one which runs out next October, began nearly two years ago. Agreement on the new five year pact, which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall, was reached at a two week session here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD .\"]   \n",

dlrs per share in cash. Earlier Supermarkets General said an unsolicited third party had made the offer. Analysts estimated the value at about 1.6 billion dlrs, based on 38.5 mln shares outstanding. Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc told Dart that Kidder s affiliate will be prepared to advance up to 750 mln dlrs on a subordinated basis.\", \"WALL STREET STOCKS SUPERMARKETS GENERAL lt SGL> Dart Group Corp lt DARTA>, which wants to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks another buyer, arbitrageurs said. Speculation that Dart s offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets shares gain one to 42 1 8 on 2.3 mln shares. One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc lt FDS> taking a look at Supermarkets General. Our policy is that we do not comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature, a Federated spokeswoman said. An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairman Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised its initial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when Safeway resisted. However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that topped the Hafts. If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the arbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts present bid seemed quite fair. He said the offer amounts to 10 times after tax cash flow which is probably fully priced. \", \"DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS lt SGL> BID lt Dart Group Corp> said it told Supermarkets General Corp lt SGL> it was flexible on the price it would pay to acquire the company. Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL s books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees. We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms, said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL s approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management s incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company s compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management s supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company s present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.\", \"DART GROUP RAISES SUPERMARKETS GENERAL lt SGL> BID lt Dart Group Corp> said it has raised its offer to acquire Supermarkets General Corp to 42.00 dlrs in cash and three dlrs in exchangeable preferred stock per Supermarkets General share from 41.75 dlrs per share in cash. The company said it would also be willing to negotiate a plan with the Supermarkets General board under which Supermarkets General shareholders would have a common stock interest in the combined company. It said it remains willing to negotiate all terms of the proposed acquisition. The original bid was worth about 1.62 billion dlrs. Dart said the preferred stock in the new bid would be exchangeable for a new class of Supermarkets General debt securities that would be developed by Dart and Supermarkets. The new proposal would be subject to approval by the Supermarkets General board, it said. The new bid was contained in a letter to the Supermarkets General board. In Woodbridge, N.J., Supermarkets General responding to a previous letter to its board by Dart said Your conduct indicates to us that no transaction involving trust and confidence can be entered into with you. Your propaganda and missstatements will not panic our board. Dart, in its previous letter, had alleged that Supermarkets General executives were seeking millions of dollar in severance and tax payments from Dart.\"]   \n",

MONETARY COURSE The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow s regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said. There is no need for action, Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels and Frankfurter Bank BHF said. Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out. One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed. Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact. But such demands could re emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit. Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates. Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January. Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation. Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year. The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing, one economist said. He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds. This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium term. These developments were increasing the Bundesbank s scope for a rate cut in the medium term, economists said. Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected. Call money rates declined to 3.75 80 pct from 3.90 95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity. Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month s major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market. The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government owned banks. Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80. One dealer said, If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down. Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.\", \"NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week s pact to keep short term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week s tender. I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks, one dealer said. They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer, he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85 95 pct, up from 3.80 90 yesterday.\", \"BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said. The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1 2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50 70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard, Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder, he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash. Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further, said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst s Hutmann. Bethmann s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. But I don t expect any convincing measures, he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60 70 pct from 3.75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.\"]   \n",

                              [\"WENDY S lt WEN> DECLNES COMMENT ON MARKET RUMORS Wendy s International Inc declined to comment on vague rumors by traders that it might be a takeover target. Wendy s is currently trading up one at 11 3 4 on turnover of more than 1.6 mln shares. A Wendy s spokesman said it was corporate policy not to comment on market rumors. He further declined to attribute active trading in Wendy s stock to a published report which stated Wall Street professionals believe that Wendy s was possibly being studied by Coca Cola Co KO with view to a possible acquisition.\", \"COCA COLA lt KO> SAYS RUMORS INCORRECT A Coca Cola Co spokesman said rumors the company is interested in acquiring Wendy s International lt WEN> are not true. Those rumors are not correct, said Carlton Curtis, an assistant vice president at Coke. We have stated many times that Coca Cola Co has no interest in an acquisition in the food service industry and thereby becoming a competitor to our food service customers. Wendy s stock has been flying high on the rumors for two days. Today, Wendy s hit a high of 13 3 8 before dropping back to 12 3 8, up 5 8 in heavy trading.\", \"TALKING POINT WENDY S INTERNATIONAL lt WEN> Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy s International Inc s stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor. Wendy s retreated from an earlier high of 13 3 8, and lost a point when Coca Cola lt KO> said the rumors were untrue. However, Wendy s remained up 5 8 at 12 3 8 on volume of more than three mln shares. Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible. Wendy s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet, a Wendy s spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill. Market sources mentioned Anheuser Busch Inc lt BUD> and Pepsico Inc lt PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy s official. It doesn t happen every day, every week, every month, but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies, said Denny Lynch, Wendy s vice president of communications. However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors. Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them. I can t put another name on it, said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy s stock. It very well could be someone s interested. But Freedman said he doesn t believe now is the right time for Wendy s to be sold. They re obviously having operational difficulties. I ve always believed at the right price Wendy s would consider an offer , but I can t believe this is the right price at the right time, Freedman said. If a transaction takes place, the buyer s going to control the situation, Freedman said. I just don t think there s anything going on. I don t think it s worth much more than where it is, said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney. Analysts said Wendy s has suffered largely from the burger wars between itself, McDonald s Corp lt MCD> and Pillsbury Co s lt PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy s, the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year, analysts said. Wendy s also fumbled when it introduced a high priced breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products, but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround. There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy s may be vulnerable to a takeover. James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy s could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break up basis. He said the company has improved its debt to equity ratio and Wendy s owns a high percent of its own restaurants 38 pct of 3,500. They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants, Murren said. Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year, Wendy s real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the fourth quarter. That was about the first time in seven quarters, he said. Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy s. My gut feeling is something s going to happen. I don t know what, she said. She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share. One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy s decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi. Wendy s is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said. Pepsi s soda is still sold in the Wendy s restaurants.\"]   \n",

       "      <td>BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow s regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said. There is no need for action, Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels and Frankfurter Bank BHF said. Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out. One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed. Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact. But such demands could re emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit. Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates. Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January. Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation. Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year. The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing, one economist said. He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds. This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium term. These developments were increasing the Bundesbank s scope for a rate cut in the medium term, economists said. Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected. Call money rates declined to 3.75 80 pct from 3.90 95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity. Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month s major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market. The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government owned banks. Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80. One dealer said, If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down. Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.</td>\n",

       "      <td>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week s pact to keep short term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week s tender. I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks, one dealer said. They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer, he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85 95 pct, up from 3.80 90 yesterday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said. The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1 2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50 70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard, Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder, he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash. Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further, said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst s Hutmann. Bethmann s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. But I don t expect any convincing measures, he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60 70 pct from 3.75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.</td>\n",

There is no need for action, Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels and Frankfurter Bank BHF said. Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month s Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out. One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed. Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact. But such demands could re emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit. Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates. Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January. Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation. Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year. The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing, one economist said. He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds. This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium term. These developments were increasing the Bundesbank s scope for a rate cut in the medium term, economists said. Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected. Call money rates declined to 3.75 80 pct from 3.90 95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity. Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month s major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market. The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government owned banks. Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80. One dealer said, If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down. Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.   \n",

Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week s pact to keep short term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week s tender. I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks, one dealer said. They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer, he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85 95 pct, up from 3.80 90 yesterday.   \n",
       "8476  BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said. The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1 2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50 70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard, Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder, he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash. Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further, said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst s Hutmann. Bethmann s Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. But I don t expect any convincing measures, he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60 70 pct from 3.75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.   \n",
